Given the failure of common latent factors in explaining the expected returns pre-
dicted by stock characteristics, we turn to popular factor models considered in em-
pirical asset pricing literature. We test whether the long-Short (unhedged) and the
beta-neutral (hedged) strategy returns are spanned by the CAPM, the Fama–French
Five-Factor model Fama and French (2015), the q5 model of Hou et al. (2021) and the mispricing factors model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017). Tables 10 and 11 re-
port the results. The only “traditional” factor that our trading strategy significantly
loads on is momentum - both the unhedged and the hedged portfolios display signif-
icantly positive betas, suggesting that momentum returns are not compensation for
undiversifiable risk. Interestingly, the hedged portfolio also loads negatively on the
RMW portfolio, suggesting that the latter does relate to common sources of risk in
stock returns, but its average return has the “wrong” sign.
Needless to say, both portfolios have significantly positive alphas with respect to
all of the models that we consider. Both the long-short (unhedged) and the beta-
neutral (hedged) strategy also positively load on the expected growth factor of Hou et
al. (2021) and on the PERF factor of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017). Interestingly, the
alphas of the unhedged strategy are positive but not statistically significant against
both of these models, while the hedged portfolio is clearly not spanned by either,
with a statistically significant alpha of about 85 basis points per month with respect
to both. This suggests that at least some of the factors utilized by these models
capture important sources of common variation in stock returns as reflected in their
covariance matrix and are thus hedged out by our construction of the beta-neutral
portfolio.
